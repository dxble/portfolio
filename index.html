      	At AUT we do many collaborative work in teams and we are always expected to work in a real life senario.
      	My team and I would have to select methodologies to use as guide lines for implemention during the project's life cycle. 
      	I have used the SCRUM manifesto which is an agile way of using the Systems development life cycle and Hybrid Agile that 
      	combines certain aspects from both ends of the spectrum of agile and waterfall. We would create many artefacts such as 
      	the burndownchart, weekly meeting minutes, work log, team retrospective, etc. Althought many of the artefacts were helpful,

       		Valuable lessons learned: <br>
      	•	Coding structure and standards are very important, it makes everything consistent and easier to understand.<br>
		•	 Working in teams, communication is very important to let people in your team know your situation in terms of what you are doing currently.<br>
		•	 Having a solid design plan from the beginning helps development phase immensely, from knowing exactly what you need to build so that you can effectively design a solution to carry through out the development phase. <br>
		•	Structure of the project files is good to have.

      <h4 style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">Unlikely Heroes</h4>
      <p style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">This is a game called unlikely heroes by my team and I developed for our assignment in Software Development Practice (COMP602) at AUT. The game is a multiplayer game made in unity that is a turn base game that requires four players, three of which are hero characters against one villain character. The features I worked on was the items system and cards GUI implementation. Looking back on the experience, having no coding standard made
      understanding other developer's work difficult.

      <h4 style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">Defense Ultimatetum:</h4>
      <p style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">This is an arcade top down 2D shooter. The player
      	would have to shoot incoming enemies in each of the 5 lanes as well as dodge incoming projectiles from certain enemies.
      	The player has the option to place walls to delay the travel of enemies. Looking back on the experience, I would have separated code where possible, to not clutter a single class with so many methods. Definently would not underestimate a project size and would put a lot more planning into the development phase such as Entity Relationship Diagrams and Unified Modeling Language.
      </p>
      <br><br><br><br><br><hr>
      <h4 style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">Top down RPG:</h4>
      <p style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">This is an RPG game made in GameMaker Studio. The goal here wasn't to finish the game but gain knowledge of how to create core features for an RPG and learning how to design a game to feel polished. For this game I had achieved movement, different rooms with enter and exits, dialogue in dynamic text boxes with npc, different bullet hell patterns with projectiles, collision detection and creating static/animated sprites to use in my game world. Doing everything would take a lot of time, therefore I was sure I wasn't going to finish this game. Overall the experience of doing a little bit of each section helped with my appreciation for each department and also gave me an insight to how intergration processes could be taken between different departments to make team synergy effective.

      <h4 style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">Solar System:</h4>
      <p style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold">This is a solar system simulation with camera movement made in OpenGl. The planet objects are all connected using a push pop matrix architecture. The planets are orbiting the sun in the same speed ratio to other planet's full rotation around the sun.

Factors I took into account was how many barrels the enemy will shoot out from, speed of which the bullets will spawn and speed of the barrels rotation.
